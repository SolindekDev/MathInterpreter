## Build Interpreter for your self!
To build a interpreter you must to have this package installed:
- gcc
- makefile
- rm (preinstalled in all of os, i think soo)

If you have every of this packages installed open the cmd and write into command below:
```
make
```

That's all! File `app` (or `app.exe` if you on windows) is your own builded interpreter!
